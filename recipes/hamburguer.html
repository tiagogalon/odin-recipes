        <p><b>How to make this Yummy hamburguer</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat
                until no longer pink. Stir frequently, and break into
                pieces. Drain off grease.</li>
            <li>Add onion, celery, and green pepper to the skillet, and
                season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring until onion
                is soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in ketchup, vinegar, sugar,
                Worcestershire sauce, and tomato sauce. Cover, reduce heat
                to low, and simmer for 20 minutes. Spoon onto buns, and serve.</li>
