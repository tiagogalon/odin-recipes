        <img src=../img/las.jpg width=450x450 alt="delicious and tasy lasagna">
        <p>Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to either
            the type of noodle or to the typical lasagna dish which is a dish
            made with several layers of lasagna sheets with sauce and other
            ingredients, such as meats and cheese, in between the lasagna noodles.
            Originally, the word lasagna was used to describe a pot in which
            food was being cooked rather than the pasta itself.  Lasagna recipes
            have been around for ages, dating back to as early as the thirteenth
            century.Today, lasagnas come in all kinds of varieties from veggies
            and cream sauces to traditional sauce and cheese lasagnas as well as
            meat lasagnas.Originated in Italy during the middle ages, lasagna
            has been attributed to the city of Naples.</p>
